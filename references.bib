Such initiatives go beyond the scope of both the digital humanities and the Black digital humanities, and aim to decolonize knowledge and enable community members to be agents rather than consumers of technological innovations. Afro-Latinx digital practices, the chapter shows, highlight complex issues such as intersectionality, post-humanism, digital materiality and, data activism as a way to showcase their complex and diverse ways to be human.},

	abstract = {The circulation of knowledge in the scientific field has always been supported by an apparatus of publications capable of legitimizing its own production. The digital era has made this system more complex, not only in terms of incorporating policies such as the Open Access ones, but also through infrastructures that seek to produce, regulate and preserve knowledge. Bijker et al. (1987) and Bowker \& Star (2000), among many others, have clearly explained how infrastructures usually start as a series of small and independent technologies with very varied technical standards to become dominant technological systems that take the form of networks that, after incorporating communities and practices, become invisible and their technological monopoly is naturalized.In the case of a scientific field such as the Digital Humanities, where the use of digital tools and resources are a key element for the construction of their epistemology, infrastructures become an essential support that also regulates their value. But do we have the same technological infrastructures in around the world? How does research is affected by the (non) existence of infrastructures that define a system where all those elements or devices for research activities are found?From a technopolitical perspective, this paper seeks to analyze the way in which the "big" infrastructures for the Digital Humanities (mainly, European) -DARIAH, CLARIN, HumaNum, among others- reveal forms of a political-technological rationality that work as an "apparatus of governmentality" (Foucault 2010) from the Global North, building a in an epistemological and technological monopoly that does not take into account the contexts and needs of researchers from different parts of the world. The intellectual impact of such asymmetry deserves close scrutiny, as it limits the scientific production. Can we talk about research in Digital Humanities in countries with obsolete infrastructures? Is the solution the simple use of infrastructures already developed in other countries or regions, or, on the contrary, should local solutions be thought of on a smaller scale and impact? What mechanisms should exist for not making invisible the scientific production of the Global South Digital Humanities that uses Global North infrastructures? Finally, and as part of this debate, where would these so-called (and for the moment non-existent) Global Digital Humanities reside if they are unequally produced and sustained?},

It is easy in our modern world to throw money at a technology to do that one thing that helps us in our work. The problem is that those "one things" tend to accumulate over time to become an unwieldy mess.Over the last few years I have noticed that I use less and less individual software, tools and techniques than I have in the past and have honed my computing to a minimal level to get more and more completed. I have pruned my work life down to the bare essentials. In doing so, I have gained control of my workday. I now have the opportunity to pursue other skills and duties that I would not have otherwise had time to attempt Whether it is via laptop, tablet or phone, I find myself using the tools and skills that allow me to get what I need done with minimal effort and then focus on other duties.I find that other aspects of my work life have adapted as well.

When used, the emphasis on available technology was dominant, as was a pedagogical emphasis on psychosocial support and social justice.

	abstract = {This article considers what ‘minimal’ might mean in the context of using minimal computing tools in the humanities classroom. Specifically, it recounts experiences teaching students to make websites using Jekyll, a popular minimal website generation tool, using different understandings of ‘minimal.’ In one, students were encouraged to use a Web browser to interact with Jekyll, but this introduced complications and did not provide students with detailed conceptual understanding. A later iteration of the course used more complex tooling (the text editor, Visual Studio Code) which proved challenging to humanities students unfamiliar with such digital tools but produced deeper conceptual understanding of the process of writing with code and for the Web. Ultimately, this paper concludes that minimal does not equate to simplistic but, more importantly, that, in the classroom, where and how ‘minimal’ is situated is both up to the instructor to determine and can greatly sway student learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {Frequently translated as "hack" or "quick fix,” the North Indian term jugaad refers to a method of solving problems by "making do" with "what is at hand." The mixed materialities and/or sources of these inventive solutions often destabilize conventional orders of representation. This article describes the formation of an affinity group, the Jugaad CoLab, that identifies three research foci—decolonial poetics, minimal computing, and pirate care—as central concerns at the intersection of digital humanities and Indian and South Asian Studies, especially outside of English, that benefit from jugaad-as-method. These concerns are reflected in the initial batch of projects, involving Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu materials, undertaken by group members as summer fellows, all of whom are graduate students and/or citizen scholars in India and Pakistan. Adapting technologies to diverse, multilingual contexts with uneven access to resources, the projects take up the cultural practice of jugaad as efficient and creative methods for building open-access, sustainable, and future-proof sites of knowledge, especially in this moment of crisis.Souvent traduit par "hack" ou "solution rapide", le terme indien jugaad désigne une méthode de résolution des problèmes qui consiste à "faire avec" ce que l'on a sous la main. La mixité des matériaux et/ou des sources de ces solutions inventives déstabilise souvent les ordres de représentation conventionnels. Cet article décrit la formation d'un groupe d'affinité, le Jugaad CoLab, qui identifie trois domaines de recherche - la poétique décoloniale, le calcul minimal et le "pirate care" - comme des préoccupations centrales à l'intersection des humanités numériques et des études indiennes et sud-asiatiques, en particulier en dehors de l'anglais, qui bénéficient du jugaad en tant que méthode. Ces préoccupations se reflètent dans le premier lot de projets, impliquant des documents en bengali, hindi, punjabi et ourdou, entrepris par les membres du groupe en tant que boursiers d'été, qui sont tous des étudiants diplômés et/ou des chercheurs citoyens en Inde et au Pakistan. En adaptant les technologies à des contextes divers et multilingues où l'accès aux ressources est inégal, les projets reprennent la pratique culturelle du jugaad en tant que méthode efficace et créative pour construire des sites de connaissance en libre accès, durables et à l'épreuve du temps, en particulier en cette période de crise.},

The edition aims at celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first edition of the poem by José Hernández, and its main goal is to offer a review of the famous poem of Argentine literature from the perspective of Digital Humanities. Through XML-TEI markup, we seek to highlight the most striking aspects of its presentation and style, enhancing its first edition. Additionally, we aim to present from this research the differences between close and distant reading approaches, their pros and cons, and their relationship with our edition.},

	abstract = {Digital scholarly editions are one of the oldest forms of output of digital humanities research projects, and arguably one of the most prolific. Like all digital humanities projects that result in the creation of digital output—typically a website—digital editions are not immune to what Smithies et al. call the “digital entropy of software and digital infrastructure”. This has a cost that grows with the complexity of the system needed to publish digital editions and this cost is often not only financial; it may also include the ability to access institutional or public infrastructure. The principles of minimal computing have informed new ways of undertaking digital humanities work, focused on use of open technologies and ownership of data and code. The latter in particular entails independence from institutional infrastructure and the network of surveillance that is a feature of many commercial platforms of the modern web. This chapter discusses the current extent of minimal computing as an influence on digital editing, and which aspects of the concept have taken stronger root. Specifically, we will consider how, when applied to digital publishing, minimal computing principles intersect with a recent resurgence of static websites and related technologies. Deriving static sites from an end-of-life project is the clear choice when access to infrastructure becomes limited. What would it take to adopt them from the start to avoid infrastructural constraints? Through this discussion, the chapter articulates the need for a low-infrastructure future of the “global” digital edition.},

	abstract = {This new collaboration between a historian of Southern Africa (RC) and a specialist in computational methods (WJT), is designed to draw on our respective backgrounds and provide opportunities to enlist students and other collaborators in research and teaching. Our goal is to create tools that can be used to help explain unfamiliar languaging in historical contexts. We follow the tenets of minimal computing (Risam \&amp; Gil 2022) and take the perspective of language as a complex adaptive system (Kretzschmar 2015). We also situate our work within the postcolonial digital humanities generally (Risam 2018) and the specific critique of knowledge production and racism that Fields \&amp; Fields (2012, pp. 5-6) identified as ‘racecraft’, which “highlights the ability of pre- or non-scientific modes of thought to hijack the minds of the scientifically literate”. As practitioners of academic language research and computing, we must be attentive to the history of colonizers trying to not only kill ‘native languages’ but their speakers and cultures (Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o 2009). To date, we have partially implemented one prototype for automating interlinear morphemic glossing of chiShona and English as shown in Figure 1 (Charumbira et al 2023). Here our intent is speculative design: to imagine a more inclusive space of computational tools and practices that jettisons some of the assumptions that have shaped the digital cultural record in the Global North.},
